             <h3><b>How i got into cosplay</b></h3>

              <p>I Encountered the idea of cosplay online like many others,intrueged by the idea of dressing up as your favorite charather 
              and meeting others who mightve enjoyed the same shows and franchies as i did, so i convinced my mom to come along to one of the cons that were held nearby and 
             thats how i began with cosplay, i bought a cheap costume and went with a few of my friends who wanted to do it to and thats how it all started. 
              From that day i got super deep into cosplay and went to even more cons and found ways to improve my costumes even more.</p>

             <h4>How about now</h4>

              <p>I started cosplaying 2 to 3 years ago and have met many people throught out going to cons and more, the cosplay community is quite nice and 
              accepting of others (from my experingens) and because of that i joined the cosplay community and went to work, making my cosplays 
              now by hand and experimenting with new and exciting things !   At the moment of now i am working on my plague doctor oufit and am going
               to ducht comic con soon.</p>
