                <p>first time cosplaying a cosplay of mine, photo done by pro</p>
                <p>this con was amazing since i made many friends and went with a whole group this time
                    i still have many things i bought and got from that con just like i still have the costume!
                    at the time i wasnt that good with wigs so i had cutted almost all of it off and made it a small bob
                    luckily it did still look good hehe</p>

                <p> i made this cosplay by 
                    hand though it still long not finished, the dress
                    has still a part that needs to be made just like the hat.
